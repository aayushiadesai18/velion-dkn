Mobile-Web Component Coursework-2

Hello! I am Aayushi Desai, a student pursuing masters in SOftware Engineering.

This was the coursework given by my university for the subject Mobile Web Component Developement.

I will first explain the case study and then move further with the code.

Velion Dynamics is a multi-national tech consulting company that was struggling to manage and share what its employees knew across different countries.

- What is happening in the case?

As the company grew, teams in different regions started working alone and kept doing work again that had already been done elsewhere, which wasted time and money.

When experienced staff left, the knowledge left with them, and new staff found it hard to locate templates, so it was difficult for them to become productive.

- What did the company do?

The company started “Project Axis” to build a Digital Knowledge Network (DKN), a cloud system where all documents, client information, and resources would be stored and shared in one place. 

The DKN focused on three main ideas- putting everything in one shared place, using AI to recommend useful content and experts to each person, and making it easier for teams in different countries to work together online.

- What problems did they face?

Some senior consultants did not trust the system and saw it as extra work, while younger staff liked it but found practical issues like bad tagging and slow performance.

There were also technical and legal challenges, like connecting old IT systems in different countries and obeying data protection laws such as GDPR and local data rules in parts of Asia.

- How did they try to fix this?

They launched a change programme called “Connect to Grow” and appointed “Knowledge Champions” in each office to train and support people, and linked use of the DKN to performance reviews and promotions.

They added leaderboard and recognition awards to make sharing knowledge attractive and to show that sharing is a sign of leadership and not just admin work.

- What were the results?

Within a year, repeated work dropped, collaboration between offices went up, new staff got up to speed faster, and clients were happier because services became more consistent and data driven.
